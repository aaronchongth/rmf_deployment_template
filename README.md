# RMF-Site
This branch contains example site-specific resources like adapters, maps and their dockerfiles to be built in a CI process upon the core Open-RMF docker images built in the main branch.

Site maps, external packages, custom dev, etc for use with your Open-RMF deployment may be added here and built as part of the CI.

As an example, these resources are added as a branch here; but for larger deployment, this branch may be spun out as a repo for keeping branch names and versioning clean.
